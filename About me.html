For the first two years of the my life in lived in Powder Springs, but then we moves to Douglasville, were we've lived ever since. There I live with my Mother, father, dog, cat, and fish. My half sister lives in New York but I see her occasionaly. Recently my grandparents bought a house in Douglasville, so they will be moving down here from Long Island, New York<p>I enjoy watching anime, playing videogames, and talking with friends. I play the tenor saxophone, watch YouTube, and just like to relax in general. I like joking around with friends and sleeping.</div>
